5 in 5 project : Day 1 – in tribute of my lost ring

5 in 5 : a creative process of creating a new single project 
in every single day in a period of 5 days – at the end of this process, 
there should be a total of 5 new projects.

On Aug 30, couple day before 5 in 5 was assigned, I’ve lost one of my rings 
which my mother gave me as a present. I tried to find a picture of the ring to 
show to my flatmates if they have seen it anywhere, I realised that this is 
the only picture that I have of that ring and yet it is so small that you could 
barely see it. The fact that I barely have no evidence of its existence saddens 
me even more. So I decided to create something ‘in tribute to my lost ring’.

I used my skillset that I’ve gained from the experience of MFADT Bootcamp to 
code this interactive game. The idea is that as the rings – which, I guess, 
has slipped from my fingers – are falling down, I need to move my hand to catch 
those rings. I decided to write my code using Processing.
